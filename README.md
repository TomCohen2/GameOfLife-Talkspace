- To run the server --> node ./index.js from the "server" folder 
- To run the client --> npm start from the "my-app" folder

Some clarification: 
 0) That's my result under the time limit of one day. 
 1) I am aware to the bugs- Not prodcution ready, no appropriate seperation between files, no appropriate error handling, socket.io issues and more. In General I AM AWARE TO MY LEVEL (Junior programmer, never wrote a signle line to production, Just finished my degree). 
 2) I am willing to learn, develop and work under junior conditions. 
 3) Hope you'll notice my potential, I'm hungry to learn a real industry standart.

What's missing?

- Mainly a proper TS
- Serious error handling
- 
What i would fix/improve if i had time/knowledge?

- Seperation between files
- Components folder for all of the App.tsx content.
- Sockets overload issues
- Much better UI
- Much cleaner code
- 
I really enjoyend working on this assignment, and hopefully the result will be satisfying. AGAIN, I am looking for a place that will see my potential and hunger.

Thanks for reviewing my work, I'll be glad to get a feedback anyway.
